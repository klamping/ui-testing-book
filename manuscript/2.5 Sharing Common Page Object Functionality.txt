# 2.5 Sharing Common Page Object Functionality

## 2.5.1 Testing the Post Editor

Now that we've got our login tests running, the next bit of functionality we want to write tests for is our Post Editor page.

This page is crucial to the user interaction on the site, as it's the interface between their ideas and their posts. As a user, nothing is more frustrating than wanting to share content but having an error in the site prevent you from doing so.

Over the next couple chapters, we'll be working on writing tests for this page. We're going to check that the following requirements are met:

- it should load page properly
- it should let you publish a new post
- it should alert you if you try navigating away from the page without saving your post

In this chapter, we're going to validate the page load. This will include the following steps:

1. Load the login page
2. Login with a valid user
3. Load the Post Editor page
4. Assert the URL is correct
5. Assert the page fields are correct

While we've done similar work in the past with our Login tests, we're going to advance our abilities by investigating how to share common functionality across our tests. 

To get things started, let's layout the basic structure for our new editor test. Create a new file in your `specs` folder named `editor.js`. In it, we'll insert our `require` statements and `describe`/`it` blocks:

```js
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const Auth = require('../pageObjects/Auth.page');

const auth = new Auth();

describe('Post Editor', function () {
    it('should load page properly', function () {
      // Load the login page
      // Login with a valid user
      // Load the Post Editor page
      // Assert the URL is correct
      // Assert the page fields are correct
    })
})
```

This structure is very similar to what we've seen with our Login page, which means that it's a good thing we've made our Auth page object available for re-use. Let's go ahead and take advantage of it by adding the login code to our test:

```js
it('should load page properly', function () {
  // Load the login page
  browser.url('./login')
  // Login with a valid user
  auth.login('demowdio@conduit.com', 'wdiodemo');
  // Load the Post Editor page
  // Assert the URL is correct
  // Assert the page fields are correct
})
```

Thinking ahead, we'll want to be logged in for all our tests in this file. This is similar to how, in our login tests, we re-loaded the login page for test using Mocha's `beforeEach` hook.

But we don't want to waste time logging in for each individual test. It would work to login at the beginning of our test suite, then re-use that session for each test. Therefore, we're going to use a `before` hook instead, which will run the login code once at the very beginning. Since WebdriverIO uses the same browser session for the entire file, we don't need to login again (when we load the editor page, it will use the authentication information stored in the browser's session). 

Using the same code as our login page, we can add in a `before` hook that will look like:

```js
describe('Post Editor', function () {
  before(function () {
    // Load the login page
    browser.url('./login')
    // Login with a valid user
    auth.login('demowdio@conduit.com', 'wdiodemo');
  })
  it('should load page properly', function () {
    // Load the Post Editor page
    // Assert the URL is correct
    // Assert the page fields are correct
  })
})
```

The next step in our test is to load the 'Editor' page. We'll do this with a simple `browser.url('./editor')` command. But where to put this? As mentioned in the previous chapter, including the `url` command in our `beforeEach` hook is my preferred approach, as it ensures we have a clean page between all our test runs. If we added to the `before` hook, changes we make in one test might impact the state of the page in another. 

Here's what the code looks like with both a `before` and a `beforeEach` hook:

```js
describe('Post Editor', function () {
  before(function () {
    // Load the login page
    browser.url('./login')
    // Login with a valid user
    auth.login('demowdio@conduit.com', 'wdiodemo');
  })
  beforeEach(function () {
    // Load the Post Editor page
    browser.url('./editor')
  })
  it('should load page properly', function () {
    // Assert the URL is correct
    // Assert the page fields are correct
  })
})
```

## 2.5.2 Has the Page Loaded Properly?

Our first test solely consists of validating that the page has loaded correctly. This is a very common test type seen across the industry as it's a common starting ground for test cases.

In fact, this type of test has a common name: "Smoke" tests. They're called that because they check for "smoke", or a quick sign that something is on fire. They goal is to quickly reveal simple failures before moving on to more in-depth testing.

While the idea may seem simple from the outside, there are a lot of questions that this type test brings up. Here are a few:

A. How much of the page do we test? Testing all elements on the page is impractical, so where do we draw the line?
B. How much maintanence does this introduce? Every element we check introduces maintanence lwhen that element is changed in the future. 
C. Should WebdriverIO even be testing this? Are there tools better suited for this type of job?

And here's my opinion:

A: We should only test what we're going to interact with in our other tests, as we want to ensure they're on the page before interacting with them. I admit this isn't the strongest argument, but I like it as a guideline.

The counter argument to that is, if the elements are missing, WebdriverIO will throw errors about the element not existing in our other tests. My reply is that we can quickly identify the problem by having a specific test to check that our page elements exist.

B: We can use page objects to reduce future maintanence, but yes, it's still exists. We always need to be careful of testing too much.

C: While these 'element check' tests are certainly something WebdriverIO can do, it might not be the best way to do it. Since you're looking at the page when it initially loads, you don't need a tool that interacts with the page, just one that reads it.

An alternative to WebdriverIO is to use [a "snapshot" testing tool like Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing). It works with web frameworks like React to render specific components and ensure they render correctly. 

Overall, be careful writing a lot of tests like this. Most of the time, it's apparent right away an element is missing, so having this sort of test only adds extra maintenance. Also, I've seen testers focus solely on this type of testing, when most of the bugs in the software appear when interacting with the website through clicks and form entry. Focus on the items most likely to break, not static data that's mostly reliable.

With all of that said, I want to continue with using this as an example as it gives us a chance to hone our Page Object creation skills from the previous chapter.

Our test is going to check the URL, then check for the existance of the following five form items: Title, Description, Body, Tags and Publish.

As we've already covered creating page objects, I'm going to show just the code needed to move forward:

Create new Editor.page.js file inside of the `pageObjects` folder:

```js
class Editor {
    get $title () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-title"]'); }
    get $description () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-description"]'); }
    get $body () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-body"]'); }
    get $tags () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-tags"]'); }
    get $publish () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-publish"]'); }
}

module.exports = Editor;
```

Then back in our test:

```js
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const Auth = require('../pageObjects/Auth.page');
const Editor = require('../pageObjects/Editor.page');

const auth = new Auth();
const editor = new Editor();

describe('Post Editor', function () {
    before(function () {
        browser.url('./login')
        auth.login('demowdio@conduit.com', 'wdiodemo');
    })
    beforeEach(function () {
        browser.url('./editor')
    })
    it('should load page properly', function () {
        expect(browser.getUrl()).to.include('editor');
        expect(editor.$title.isExisting(), 'Title').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$description.isExisting(), 'Description').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$body.isExisting(), 'Body').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$tags.isExisting(), 'Tags').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$publish.isExisting(), 'Publish').to.be.true;
    })
})
```

To recap, we create a new Editor class with our element references, then require that file inside our test and use those element references to check for their existance. 

You can give your tests a quick run with `npx wdio --spec=editor` and validate that it passes. 

## 2.5.3 Storing Common Credentials as Test Fixtures

Before moving on, I'd like to review the fact that we have common login credentials shared between our two test files. If the username/password ever change, this is going to mean extra work for us, as we'll have to update in multiple places. Before we get too far down the road of redefining these credentials in even more files, let's look at how we can store them in a common file for reference in our tests.

Similar to how we store our page objects in separate files, we can do the same with our login credentials. Let's create a new file, and in it, define an object which will store information on multiple users:

```js
const users = {
    user1: {
        email: 'demowdio@conduit.com',
        password: 'wdiodemo'
    }
};

module.exports = users;
```

Reviewing this code, we create a `users` object, and attach the individual user information as a property on this object. We only have one user defined right now (we'll add more later). This user (`user1`) property is itself an object, with `email` and `password` property/value pairs. 

We use the standard `module.exports` to pass back the `users` object to whatever file requires it. 

Now we need to save this file and load it in our test. But where to save it? It's not a page object, so including it in that folder wouldn't make sense. Same goes for it being in the 'test' folder.

What we need to do is create a new folder for static test data. Luckily, there's a name for that: 'fixtures'. A 'test fixture' is a 'fixed' bit of data that stays the same between test runs, so that test runs are repeatable. Here, our user information will always have the same values, hence they're a 'fixture'. Other examples of fixtures are:

- Files used for testing file upload functionality
- "Known" data for validating page components like tables or dynamic lists (e.g. when I sort by the 'Name' column, I expect 'Aaron' to be the first row)
- "Known" data for validating form submissions (e.g. when I submit a new post titled 'My Awesome Post', I expect to be taken to a page with 'My Awesome Post' as the title)

There are other types of test fixtures out there, and we'll cover instances of 'fixtures' that aren't actually static. But for now, how about we get back to our users file?

Let's create a `fixtures` folder to live next to our `specs` and `pageObjects` folder. After creating it, you should have a folder structure like this:

```
./
./wdio.conf.js
./test/fixtures/
./test/specs/
./test/pageObjects/
```

We'll name our file `users.js`, as it contains our user information. Now, back in our `editor.js` file, we can import that data using `const { user1 } = require('../fixtures/users');`.

If you're not familiar with 'object destructuring', that syntax might look a little strange. If we imported the entire `users` object via `const users = require('../fixtures/users');`, we'd need to get our `user1` property out of it like so: `const user1 = users.user1`. 

Instead, we use [object destructuring](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_destructuring.html) to automatically create that `user1` constant when we require the file. It's the same result, just a little bit more concise.

To use our `user1` constant, we update our `auth.login` code to pass in the property values: `auth.login(user1.email, user1.password);`

Here's what the fully updated file looks like:

```js
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const Auth = require('../pageObjects/Auth.page');
const Editor = require('../pageObjects/Editor.page');
const { user1 } = require('../fixtures/users');

const auth = new Auth();
const editor = new Editor();

describe('Post Editor', function () {
    before(function () {
        browser.url('./login')
        auth.login(user1.email, user1.password);
    })
    beforeEach(function () {
        browser.url('./editor')
    })
    it('should load page properly', function () {
        expect(browser.getUrl()).to.include('editor');
        expect(editor.$title.isExisting(), 'Title').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$description.isExisting(), 'Description').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$body.isExisting(), 'Body').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$tags.isExisting(), 'Tags').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$publish.isExisting(), 'Publish').to.be.true;
    })
})
```

## 2.5.4 Using and Updating the Auth Login Function

Fair warning: This next section will not focus on testing much at all. It's entirely unnecessary and you'll likely be well enough having skipped over it. If you're like me, then, you're very curious to read more about it.

Our `auth.login` function takes two parameters: a username and a password. We pass those values in as part of our 'user' object, which is to be expected.

But why not just pass in the entire user object and let the function handle separating things out? The reason here is that "we initially coded the function to work this way, back when we were just hardcoding the values via strings."

I mention all of this because it's quite common to follow a pattern due to always having done it that way. In order to preserve brainpower, we develop reusable patterns based on a specific way of thinking. We then re-use these standards elsewhere, even when a better option exists, out of pure habit.

In this instance, we follow the "two parameters" pattern, even when it would be simpler to pass in only the object now that we've switched to that.

But, and this is why I prefaced this entire section, it almost entirely doesn't matter whether we pass in a single object or two strings. From a code re-usability standpoint, they're almost the same. In fact, passing in two strings is more clear from an upfront readability standpoint, as someone reading the tests will understand what's inside the `user1` object without having to trace it down. 

It's all one big trade-off.

For the sake of my argument though, let's switch to passing in an object, in an effort to save effort down the road. First, we need to update our function call to pass in the object, instead of the parts. That's a simple change, as we just delete half the function call:

```js
auth.login(user1);
```

This is the big payoff of this approach. A much more concise login call.

Now for slightly more complicated part. In our `Auth.page.js` file, we need to update our `login` function to accept an object with two properties. It used to be trickier, but with "named parameters", we can do a little trick that looks like:

```js
login ({ email, password} ) {
```

All we did was add curly braces around what are now our property names. If you're looking for more information on how this works, [Wes Bos has a video on how these "Named Parameters" work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2PGgkCIjEA). This trick can be helpful in your day-to-day coding, so I think it's well worth knowing if you're unfamiliar with it.

Okay, one last bit before our transition is complete... while it works to pass in the `user1` object for our `editor.js` file, our `login.js` file isn't as easy. There, we're still using the strings to test different credentials.

Since we need to pass in missing details, sending over the full object won't work. Instead, we can update our functions to send in partial data where necessary.

For the first test in the `login.js` file, we can switch over to using the `user1` like we've done in our `editor.js` file. For the other two, we need to define a new object to pass over, using the relevant `user1` property, plus a blank property:

```js
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const Auth = require('../pageObjects/Auth.page');
const { user1 } = require('../fixtures/users');

const auth = new Auth();

describe('Login Form', function () {
    beforeEach(function () {
        browser.url('./login');
    })

    it('should let you log in', function () {
        auth.login(user1);

        // Get the URL of the page, which should no longer include 'login'
        expect(browser.getUrl()).to.not.include('/login');
    });

    it('should error with a missing username', function () {
        auth.login({
            email: '',
            password: user1.password
        });

        expect(auth.$errorMessages.getText()).to.equal(`email can't be blank`);
    });

    it('should error with a missing password', function () {
        auth.login({
            email: user1.email,
            password: ''
        });

        expect(auth.$errorMessages.getText()).to.equal(`password can't be blank`);
    });
});
```

Now we've got all our files updated to a new way of thinking and can get back to building out our new Editor test.

## 2.5.5 Abstracting the Page Load

Just kidding! If you haven't figured it out by now, I really dislike implementation details (e.g. element selectors) in my tests. And right now, there are too many URLs just floating around everywhere!

For one, we're repeating the `browser.url('./login')` command in both our login and editor tests. While it's not a huge problem right now, it will grow everytime we add a new test. Soon enough, we'll have this URL scattered throughout our tests, and any update to the path will require fixing every file we have. That just won't do.

Just like we added element selector information to our page object, we can also add the page url to it. But we won't do it through a 'getter'; instead we'll create a `load` function that we'll call to run our `browser.url` command:

```js
class Login {
    load() {
        browser.url('./login');
    }
}
```

```js
before(function () {
    auth.load();
    auth.login(user1);
})
```

Now, we could call that `load` function from inside our login function, and I'm really tempted to do just that. But, I don't want distract us yet again with yet another micro-optimization, especially when we're already in the middle of one. So I'll leave it up to you for that (in the chapter challenges of course)

We can do the same thing for our Editor page object:

```js
class Editor {
    load() {
        browser.url('./editor');
    }
}
```

And in the `beforeEach` hook of our `editor.js` file:

```js
beforeEach(function () {
    editor.load();
})
```

You know, we're going to follow this `load` function pattern a fair bit for all of our future page objects. It sure would be nice not to have to write the same `load` function over and over...

## 2.5.6 Common Page Objects

Which brings us to our next project: Using `generic` classes to provide standard functionality across our page objects. Sounds fun so let's dive in!

The `class` keyword we've been using to build out our page objects comes with the ability to `extend` a base class. It allows you to build off of another class to extend its capabilities.

Think of it like a smartphone. Everyone buys the same standard phone, then they 'extend' that phone's capabilities by customizing details and adding specific apps they want to use. In that same vein, we're going to create a 'base' page object, and customize/extend it for each specific page we want to define. 

As I mentioned, it would be nice to avoid redefining that `load` function across our objects. To do this, we're going to create a `Generic` page object class, then `extend` it all over the place.

In our `Generic` class, we'll define a `load` function, similar to the one we defined in our `Login` and `Editor` objects:

```js
class Generic {
    load() {
        browser.url(???);
    }
}

module.exports = Generic;
```

But how do we know what URL to load? (Hence the ???)

Well, we can pass that information in through a `constructor` function. Constructors are called on classes when they're instantiated, so if I were to instantiate a class like so:

```js
const genericPage = new Generic('something');
```

I could get that value passed in via my constructor function:

```js
class Generic {
  constructor (information) {
    console.log(information);
  }
}
```

Now when I run that initial code, it will log out `something` to the console. `constructor` is a special function that will be run whenever the class is instantiated. You don't have to call it in your code; it's just part of the built-in class system.

With that knowledge, we can pass in the URL:

```js
class Generic {
  constructor (path) {
    console.log(path); // will log out './login', which is passed in below
  }
}

const genericPage = new Generic('./login');
```

This path value can be stored to the class's `this` value and then used in the `load` function (similar to how we access element references):

```js
class Generic {
  constructor (path) {
    this.path = path;
  }
  
  load() {
    browser.url(this.path); // navigates to './login', which is passed in below
  }
}

const genericPage = new Generic('./login');
```

## 2.5.7 Time to 'extend' our generic page

That's all fine and dandy, but we're not using 'Generic' pages. We want this to work with our Auth and Editor page objects. We need these classes to 'extend' our Generic page object functionality, which is where the `extends` keyword comes in.

We can define a class to 'extend' another class, similar to the phone analogy before. Both Editor and Auth will extend the base functionality of Generic, including that wonderful `load` function. 

```js
class Generic {
  constructor (path) {
    this.path = path;
  }
  
  load() {
    browser.url(this.path); // navigates to './login', which is passed in below
  }
}

class Auth extends Generic {
  // element references and login function left out for brevity
}

const auth = new Auth('./login');
```

Now our Auth class has that `load` function built in, so our `beforeEach` hook now looks like:

```js
beforeEach(function () {
  auth.load();
})
```

That's nice, but I don't like passing in the login path via the class instantiation line. We're going to need to use the Auth class in several tests, and it'll be the same issue that we're defining that path in every test. What if we instead store that path information inside the Auth class itself?

Well, in the same way we defined a constructor function in our Generic page, we can define that in our Auth page as well. And instead of it accepting a path, we just set the `this.path` value ourselves:

```js
class Auth extends Generic {
  constructor () {
    this.path = './login';
  }
  
  // element references and login function left out for brevity
}
```

Great, now we can instantiate our Auth page without the path: `const auth = new Auth();`. This all works, but isn't very elegant. We now have a constructor function defined in the Generic class that isn't really being used. I'd rather have my Auth class pass the path to the Generic constructor function, similar to how we pass in the path via instantiation.

## 2.5.8 The 'super' keyword

Well, there's one more trick up the Class sleeve. From within our Auth class constructor, we can 'call up' (or down, not really sure) to the Generic constructor using the `super` keyword:

```js
class Auth extends Generic {
  constructor () {
    super('./login');
  }
  // element references and login function left out for brevity
}
```

With this code, when Auth is instantiated, its `constructor` function will be called. This function will call the Generic's constructor via the `super` keyword, passing in our desired path. The Generic constructor function will take over, storing the path information to `this.path`. When `auth.load()` is then called, it will use that stored information and load our login page as desired. We can do the same thing with our Editor class:

```js
class Editor extends Generic {
  constructor () {
    super('./editor');
  }
  // element references left out for brevity
}
```

Phew, that's a lot of information to wrap your brain around. If you're looking for alternative explanations, I highly suggest loading up YouTube and watching any of the top videos found when searching "javascript class constructor super". Here are a few:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBLIm5LMrmc
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tllw4EPhLiQ

These videos dive into the idea deeper than I get into here and are great to help solidify what we just talked about. We're going to be using this pattern a fair bit moving forward, so it's worth it to spend time learning about the topic.

## 2.5.9 Implementing our Generic Page Object

We've gone through a lot of theory and have reworked the code several times. Let's look at what our final implementation of this idea is going to be. The first item on our list is to create the file for our Generic page object. We'll name the file `Generic.page.js`, and store it in our `page_objects` folder.

The contents of that file will be:

```js
class Generic {
    constructor (path) {
        this.path = path
    }
    load() {
        browser.url(this.path);
    }
}

module.exports = Generic;
```

Next up, we need to update our Auth and Editor files to import the Generic page object and extend it:

```js
const Generic = require('./Generic.page');

class Auth extends Generic {
    constructor () {
        super('./login')
    }
    
    get $email () { return $('input[type="email"]'); }
    get $password () { return $('input[type="password"]'); }
    get $signIn () { return $('button*=Sign in'); }
    get $errorMessages () { return $('.error-messages li'); }

    login ({ email, password }) {
        this.$email.setValue(email);
        this.$password.setValue(password);

        this.$signIn.click();

        // wait until either the sign in button is gone or an error has appeared
        browser.waitUntil(() => {
            const signInExists = this.$signIn.isExisting();
            const errorExists = this.$errorMessages.isExisting();

            return !signInExists || errorExists;
        }, null, 'The sign in button is not gone and an error never appeared');
    }
}

module.exports = Auth;
```

```js
const Generic = require('./Generic.page');

class Editor extends Generic {
    constructor () {
        super('./editor')
    }
    
    get $title () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-title"]'); }
    get $description () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-description"]'); }
    get $body () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-body"]'); }
    get $tags () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-tags"]'); }
    get $publish () { return $('[data-qa-id="editor-publish"]'); }
}

module.exports = Editor;
```

With those adjustments made, we can run our tests again, which now use `auth.load()` and `editor.load()` and validate they all pass with flying colors. 

## 2.5.10 Using our Page Object's Path in tests

If you had a close eye on the editor test, you may have noticed this line:

```js
expect(browser.getUrl()).to.include('editor');
```

There's a similar line going on with one of our login tests:

```js
expect(browser.getUrl()).to.not.include('/login');
```

If we've defined those path values in our page objects, why aren't we using them in our tests? Let's get to fixing that!

Similar to how we can access element references in our tests (e.g. `editor.$title`), we can also access properties defined to the `this` value. That means we can access that `path` property via `editor.path`. So we could update our test to be:

```js
expect(browser.getUrl()).to.include(editor.path);
```

But there's a problem with that. If we were to run the test, it would fail with the error message: `expected 'https://demo.learnwebdriverio.com/editor' to include './editor'`

The reason for this is that `path` is set to `./editor` and not just `/editor`. Why the extra `.`? Well if you remember back to Chapter 2.1, we needed to set our path to be relative to the `baseUrl`. Using the `.` does just that. 

That means we can't change our `path` property definition, because it would break our tests if we have a baseUrl with a built-in path. That leaves us with a few options:

1. Manually trim off the `.` from the start of the path: `editor.path.substr(1);`
2. Create a second property that doesn't have a the `.`: `this.path = '/editor';`
3. Use the NodeJS `URL` module to parse the path

I don't like option 1 because our test now needs to 'do work'. It's not just consuming information, it's modifying it to be in a specific format. I heavily shy away from this, as it can easily introduce bugs into your test code, which we want to avoid at all costs. No one wants to write tests for their tests.

Option 2 isn't great as now we're redefining the same information. It means an extra line of code that offers very little value.

Instead, let's try out option 3 and see if we can get some added benefit from the work. 

## 2.5.11 Taking advantage of NodeJS's URL utility

NodeJS comes several built-in utilities, some of which we've already tried out (e.g. the `Assert` module). As I mentioned, there's [a `URL` module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/url.html) we can use to define and parse URLs.

URLs may seem simple, but they can be very complex. Take a look at the example structure provided by the NodeJS website:

TODO Fix this formatting

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                              href                                              │

│          │  │                     │                 │      │          ├─┬──────────────┤       │

"  https:   //    user   :   pass   @ sub.example.com : 8080   /p/a/t/h  ?  query=string   #hash "
│          │  │          │          │    hostname     │ port │          │                │       │
│          │  │          │          ├─────────────────┴──────┤          │                │       │
│ protocol │  │ username │ password │          host          │          │                │       │

│   origin    │                     │         origin         │ pathname │     search     │ hash  │
├─────────────┴─────────────────────┴────────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────────┴───────┤
│                                              href                                              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
(all spaces in the "" line should be ignored — they are purely for formatting)
```

All of that can go into a URL, and trying to break a URL string into those separate parts is complicated. But this is where the URL module helps out. We can pass in that very long, complex URL string to the module, and it will return to us a `URL Object` that has all of those properties defined for us to use. 

For example:

```js
const url = require('url');

const myURL = new URL('https://user:pass@sub.example.com:8080/p/a/t/h?query=string#hash');
console.log(myURL.hash);
// prints `#hash`

console.log(myURL.pathname);
// Prints /p/a/t/h
```

Any property defined in the chart above can be accessed as a property on our URL. 

Another neat bit about the URL constructor is that it doesn't need to be a single string that we pass in. We can send it parts of our url, and it will piece together everything into a full object:

```js
const myURL = new URL('/foo', 'https://example.org/');
// https://example.org/foo
```

In this example, we send over the `path` and `host` in separate strings, and the URL constructor joins them correctly. This matches up with our tests, as we have our `path` in our page object and the `host` stored as our `baseUrl` in our config. Now we just need to combine those two to make our URL object.

We want to store the URL object in our Generic page as `this.url`. This is almost the same as `this.path`, except we'll be constructing our object instead of passing it in as a string.

To get the `baseUrl` from inside of our page object, we can reference `browser.options`. This is a store of most of the options we defined inside our `wdio.conf.js` file, including our `baseUrl` property. It's really handy to know about for specific circumstances, so commit it to memory.

Putting this alltogether, our Generic page object now looks like:

```js
const { URL } = require('url');

class Generic {
    constructor (path) {
        this.path = path;

        // store the url by combining specific page path with WDIO base url
        // using the NodeJS URL utility
        this.url = new URL(path, browser.options.baseUrl);
    }
    load() {
        browser.url(this.path);
    }
}

module.exports = Generic;
```

Note that we added the `require` statement to the top of the file, and our `load` function stayed the same. All we're doing here is adding a new property for our Editor and Auth pages to use. I think it's neat that we can add this new property to our Generic page, and magically have it available in our other pages.

## 2.5.12 Finishing the URL implementation

Okay, now that we've got our page objects updated, let's put this to use in our test. Our assertion is checking that the URL is correct for the page we want to be on. It was doing a partial check before, validating that the path exists inside the returned url. But now that we can build out the full url, why not do a strict match to really make sure we're on the same page. 

The url object that we've constructed contains an `href` property that will return the entire URL. We can compare that against what's returned from the browser to complete our assertion: `expect(browser.getUrl()).to.equal(editor.url.href);`

Notice that we're using `to.equal` now versus `to.contain` from before. Again, this is due to our ability to combine the `path` and `baseUrl` values to make a fully qualified URL. Here's what the fully updated `editor.js` file now looks like:

```js
const expect = require('chai').expect;
const Auth = require('../pageObjects/Auth.page');
const Editor = require('../pageObjects/Editor.page');
const { user1 } = require('../fixtures/users');

const auth = new Auth();
const editor = new Editor();

describe('Post Editor', function () {
    before(function () {
        auth.load();
        auth.login(user1);
    });
    beforeEach(function () {
        editor.load();
    });
    it('should load page properly', function () {
        expect(browser.getUrl()).to.equal(editor.url.href);
        expect(editor.$title.isExisting(), 'Title').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$description.isExisting(), 'Description').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$body.isExisting(), 'Body').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$tags.isExisting(), 'Tags').to.be.true;
        expect(editor.$publish.isExisting(), 'Publish').to.be.true;
    });
});
```

Likewise, we can update our valid login test in `login.js`  to use this `url` property:

```js
it('should let you log in', function () {
    auth.login(user1);

    // Get the URL of the page, which should no longer include 'login'
    expect(browser.getUrl()).to.not.equal(auth.url.href);
});
```

Well, that sure was a lot to go through for a simple test. It's worth it though. By extending more generic classes, we can continue to grow our automation test suite without running into issues with code duplication, which can create maintenance nightmares in the long run.

One final note: you can have classes that extend classes that extend classes. Right now, we have a Generic class, but we could also have a SlightlyLessGeneric class that's extended by specific page types. We'll take a look at that in a few chapters, but next up is learning how to test complex inputs.

## 2.5.13 Chapter Challenge

- Move the Auth's `load` function call to be inside the `login` function.
- Add element references to the Generic page for common items like the site navigation and page footer
